Warning : Library cell has no output pins defined. [LBR-9]
        : Library cell 'ANTENNA' must have an output pin.
        : Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the library. Else the library cell will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable. Timing_model means that the cell does not have any defined function. If there is no output pin, Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for mapping and it will not be picked up from the library for synthesis. If you query the attribute 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be: 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend upon the output function defined in the pin group (output pin) of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin will not have any function defined.

Sequential clock pins without clock waveform

The following sequential clock pins have no clock waveform driving them.  No    
timing constraints will be derived for paths leading to or from these pins.

Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design.  Either no paths in the design satisfy the exception's path             
specification, or all paths that satisfy the path specification also satisfy an 
exception with a higher priority.  You can improve runtime and memory usage by  
removing these exceptions if they are not truly needed.  To see if there is a   
path in the design that satisfies the path specification for an exception, or   
to see what other exception is overriding an exception because of priority, use 
the command:

Inputs without clocked external delays

The following primary inputs have no clocked external delays.  As a result the  
timing paths leading from the ports have no timing constraints derived from     
clock waveforms.  The'external_delay' command is used to create new external    
delays.

| CDFG-428 |Warning |    4 |In legacy_ui mode, Genus creates a blackbox as     |
|          |        |      | description for a module is not found. Black      |
|          |        |      | boxes represent unresolved references in the      |
|          |        |      | design and are usually not expected. Another      |
|          |        |      | possible reason is, some libraries are not read   |
|          |        |      | and the tool could not get the content for some   |
|          |        |      | macros or lib_cells.                              |
|          |        |      |Check the kind of module a black box is. If it is  |
|          |        |      | a lib_cell or a macro, check why the              |
|          |        |      | corresponding .lib was not read in. This could be |
|          |        |      | either due to a missing or faulty file or due to  |
|          |        |      | an incomplete init_lib_search_path attribute      |

|          |        |      | file. If it is a module of your design, verify    |
|          |        |      | whether the path to this module is a part of the  |
|          |        |      | files you read or else check that the             |
|          |        |      | init_hdl_search_path attribute is not missing     |
|          |        |      | some paths.                                       |
